#### Project Introduction

---
A lightweight template for developing REST APIs based on Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, driven by Mongoose.

It integrates Swagger UI, JWT, sessionMiddleware, email verification, log management, and a unified, predefined status code response format, making it extremely useful for building clean web APIs for front-end platforms.


In this project, I've tried to create a template that makes the code structure easy to maintain, so any beginner can adopt this process and start building APIs.


This project is open to the public; please submit suggestions and bug reports.
